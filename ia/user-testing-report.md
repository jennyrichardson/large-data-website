## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- There wern't really any usability issues, they were able to find everything on their own.

### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- All of them suceeded with little to no troubles.

### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- The only thing I may have to change is a button on my home page directing the user to the "types of bats" page, instead of just hyperlinking the words in the text.
