The purpose of this card sort was to determine common navigation patterns and categories from the content of my large data-oriented website about bats.

## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	-  The participants didn't have any comments.
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	- They didn't have any questions. 
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	- Kayla created her own categories to lay out the content in a more simple way to understand.
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	- They were fairly similar, for the most part. Most of the similatiries were in the cards that had to do with the infomation about bats as a species and their anatomy.  
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
 	- The groupings weren't very unexpected. Some of them were out of place in my opinion, but would still make sense.
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	- I think Kayla did a good job of laying it out how I envisioned it, but the category titles she added in herself improved the groupings even more. I think Lisa had a bit of a different thought process of the groupings than I originally had, but there were still some simiarities in our thinking patterns. 
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	- I felt like I didn't do the initial content properly and was worried that they wouldn't be able to find areas to put everything in a way that made sense. I think they both did a good job at categorizing my content though.
