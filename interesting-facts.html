				<h2><A NAME="Fun Facts">Fun Facts About Bats</A></h2>
		
					<ol><strong>1. Bats are the only mammals able to fly</strong>
				 And you thought it was the winged marmoset! Bats are exceptional in the air. Their wings are thin, giving them what is called, in flight terms, "airfoil." The power bats have to push forward is called "propulsion."</ol>

					<ol><strong>2. A single brown bat can catch around 1,200 mosquito-size insects in one hour</strong> In Bracken Cave, Texas, it's estimated that the 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats that live there eat about 200 tons of insects . . . each night.</ol>

					<ol><strong>3. Vampire bats don't suck blood. They lap it up. Calm down</strong> There are only three species of vampire bats in the whole world. If you are traveling in Central or South America, however, you might see a vampire bat bite a cow and then lick blood from the wound -- no sucking involved.</ol>
								
					<ol><strong>4. Bats don't have "fat days</strong>" The metabolism of a bat is enviable -- they can digest bananas, mangoes, and berries in about 20 minutes.</ol>
								
					<ol><strong>5. Fewer than 10 people in the last 50 years have contracted rabies from North American bats</strong> Due to movies and television, bats are thought to be germ machines, bringing disease and toxins to innocent victims. Not true. Bats avoid people. If you are bitten by a bat, go to the doctor, but don't start making funeral arrangements -- you'll probably be fine.</ol>
								
					<ol><strong>6. Bats use echolocation to get around in the dark</strong> Bats don't see very well and do a lot of living at night, so they have to rely on navigational methods other than sight. Bats send out beeps and listen for variations in the echoes that bounce back at them and that's how they get around. Bats are nocturnal, mostly because it's easier to hunt bugs and stay out of the way of predators when it's dark. Bats do use their eyesight to see things in the daytime, but most bat business is done under the blanket of night for convenience.</ol>

				<h2><A NAME="Myths About Bats">Myths About Bats</A></h2>
					<p><strong>Myth: Bats are blind</strong></p>

						<li>Bats use echolocation - a sort of radar - to find their way around.
							They can "see" much better than any person!</li>
									 
									
					<p><strong>Myth: All bats have rabies</strong></p>
						<li>Not true. Like many wild animals such as skunks, raccoons and foxes, bats can carry rabies. But the chances of being bitten by--and 					                            getting rabies from--a bat are extremely small.
							In fact, bee stings are actually way more dangerous to people!
							No matter what, the best advice is never to touch a bat or any other wild animal.</li>
									 
									
					<p><strong>Myth: Bats attack people</strong></p>
						<li>Most bats are gentle animals and would much rather get out of a person's way than to attack him or her. Would you pick a fight with something so much bigger than you?</li>
									 
									
					<p><strong>Myth: Bats fly into people's hair</strong></p>
						<li>Simply not true. Silly, and maybe even funny to picture, but it just doesn't happen.</li>
									 
									
					<p><strong>Myth: Bats are pests</strong></p>
						<li>Wrong. Bats help control pests! A single bat can snap up over 600 mosquitoes in one hour, as well as other little pests! Some species of bats even take part in the life cycle of plants by pollinating them.</li>
									 
									
					<p><strong>Myth: Vampire bats latch on and suck blood from people.</strong></p>
						<li>Not true. There really are vampire bats. But they live only in tropical regions of Central and South America. Although they do feed on blood, it is usually animal blood. The bat drinks by making a quick slice with its sharp teeth and lapping up a spoonful or two. They do not latch on and suck blood, and they certainly don't turn animals—or people—into vampires! Vampire bats actually have helped people. Vampire bat saliva contains chemicals - called anticoagulants - that keep blood from clotting. From their research on vampire bats, scientists have developed a medicine to help heart patients. Guess what they called that drug? Draculin!</li>
