# Pros For all three of my style tiles I kept the same layout for all of my assets, because it’s an all around easy layout for anyone to use. Most of my changes were in the mood of the website, with colours, fonts, and different looking submit buttons. The pros for all three of my style tiles are: they all have proper hierarchy, because the h1 is always bold and stands out the most, then the h2 and h3 are different enough in size and colour, that the person reading will understand the level of importance of what they are reading. The block quotes stand off the page, either by the use of a drop shadow, or a different colour, and the ordered and unordered lists are in a different colour than the body copy so that they stand out as well. The links are a series of three different colours, a medium colour, a lighter colour to indicate that the user is hovered over it and a bold dark colour link to let the user know that link has been clicked. The biggest difference in all three are the colours, and style of button. The first stile tile has a warm colour palette that I personally like the best, because it is inviting to all sorts of people, and the buttons are large and bold so that they stand out, and would come in handy for people who may have vision problems. The second stile tile has a cooler theme that is still attractive, with buttons that are smaller and a bit more simple, but at the same time they are still easy to find. The last stile tile has a more earthy theme going for it, which might be more appropriate for the subject matter of the website. The block quote is flat and inside the box is a different colour, which is different from using the drop shadow in the other two stile tiles, but still effective in separating itself from the page. The buttons are a combination of both of the buttons from my first style tile and my second style tile, and are also easy to find on the page.# ConsI don’t think there are too many cons in each stile tile, but some things that might not work is the use of so many different colours for the headers and the lists. Different weights may be enough to indicate a change in what someone is reading, making colour change unnecessary. My first stile tile’s buttons may be too bog and bulky for some people. My block quotes in the first and second stile tile may not need a drop shadow, the change in colour of the box in my third stile tile may be enough, or since the quotes are large and a different colour from the text, that may be enough as well. The second stile tile might be too purple and could potentially confuse people who have entered the website, because they could see it as a feminine colour, or just not a colour that they associate with bats/nature, so it’s probably better to either go with a more neutral colour palette, like in the first stile tile, or the earthy tones in the last stile tile.
