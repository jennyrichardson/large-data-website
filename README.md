# Bats

Bats are incredible mammals, and are often misunderstood and feared by many people. I am interested in learning more about their species and what they offer to the world. I also love their anatomy, and I think they are very interesting. 

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
